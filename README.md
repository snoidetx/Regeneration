# Regeneration

Since the Industrail Age, we have been destroying our planet faster and faster. People are not sufficiently aware of this and most have an unsustainable living style, which has been stimulating climate change and global warming. Through the game _Regeneration_, we hope to alert people to the issue and motivate them to live sustainably.

Player can choose what they plan to do in 20 years' time - whether to develop industry, healthcare, agriculture or renewable energy - but at most once per category. They can also choose people's living mode - high living mode implies higher standard of living, but it also entails higher energy consumption; while low living mode consumes less energy, but it also reduces birth rate. Different decisions made will affect the planet differently, which will finally determine human's destiny. All data are based on the Earth.   
Please live as long as you can.
